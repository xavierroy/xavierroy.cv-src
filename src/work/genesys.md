At Genesys, I led core documentation efforts for the Genesys Cloud platform, supporting both end-user and developer-facing content. My focus was on scale, clarity, and aligning documentation strategy with evolving product and platform goals.

Working with cross-functional teams across time zones, I championed automation, content reuse, and systemic thinking in how we created, maintained, and measured docs.

### Key Contributions

- Created editorial and architectural frameworks for 20+ product documentation streams across the Genesys Cloud CX platform.
- Developed internal tooling, templates, and review processes to enable faster, more consistent content delivery by distributed writing teams.
- Advocated for and helped implement a structured information architecture that improved topic discoverability and user self-service.
- Served as the liaison between product managers, engineers, and doc teams, helping shift from a feature-first to user-needs-first approach in documentation planning.
- Conducted writing workshops and content clinics across APAC and North America to elevate content quality and clarity.

### Outcomes

- Improved user satisfaction scores on documentation by 30% over two years (via customer feedback and analytics).
- Enabled PMs and developers to contribute content confidently using lightweight markdown templates and GitHub review flows.
- Helped reduce support tickets related to unclear documentation by 25% in high-traffic areas like API onboarding and integrations.
