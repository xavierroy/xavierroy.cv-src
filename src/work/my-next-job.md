In my next role, I aim to lead or contribute to a documentation and developer experience team where clarity, reuse, and human-first systems take center stage.

Iâ€™m looking to apply 20+ years of experience toward building tools, teams, and systems that help people understand complex products with more ease and less friction.

### What I Hope to Build

- Docs-as-code workflows that feel joyful to use
- Scalable documentation ecosystems powered by modular content and smart automation
- Collaborative relationships across product, engineering, and UX

### What I Bring

- Editorial depth and technical breadth
- Systems thinking and toolsmith instincts
- A calm presence in complex, ambiguous, or high-stakes environments
