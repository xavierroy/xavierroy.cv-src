At Scientific Games, I led documentation strategy for large-scale lottery and gaming platforms used by governments and gaming vendors worldwide.

### Key Contributions

- Built a centralized style guide and editorial checklist, used by writers and PMs across India and the US.
- Managed content delivery for flagship lottery systems and multi-channel gaming platforms.
- Led localization and translation efforts, coordinating with vendors to deliver content in 15+ languages.
- Conducted training and mentoring for junior writers, editors, and QA teams on documentation standards.

### Outcomes

- Cut translation costs by ~30% through content reuse and structure.
- Built a culture of quality and consistency that carried forward across product generations and M&A transitions.
